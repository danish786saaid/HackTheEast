Badge Forge — Demo Narration Script (for MiniMax Speech-02 or manual recording)

---

[INTRO — 10 seconds]

"We solve content overload for fast-moving fields by generating a 3-step adaptive
learning path from curated GMAsia content and issuing a verifiable OAX-style badge
on completion — all demoed in 90 seconds."

[DEMO WALKTHROUGH — 50 seconds]

"Here's our GMAsia content feed — dozens of articles, videos, and exercises across
AI, crypto, and policy. A learner types their goal: 'Understand LLM safety basics.'

Badge Forge uses embedding similarity and recency ranking to surface the most
relevant items. Then MiniMax generates a personalized 3-step path: Read a safety
primer, Watch an RLHF lecture, and Practice red-teaming an LLM — all in under
90 minutes.

Each step shows a one-sentence summary and time estimate. The explainability panel
reveals similarity and recency scores so learners see why each item was chosen.

When the learner completes the path, they click Claim Badge. Badge Forge issues a
signed JSON credential using HMAC-SHA256 — verifiable, portable, and tamper-proof."

[CLOSING — 20 seconds]

"Badge Forge saves hours of content discovery, delivers personalized micro-learning,
and produces verifiable outcomes. With MiniMax for intelligent generation and OAX-style
badges for trust, we turn information overload into focused, credentialed learning."
