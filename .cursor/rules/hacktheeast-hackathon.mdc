# HackTheEast – Agent Context

## Problem statement (fill when released)

<!-- Add the official problem statement / theme here on hackathon day. -->

**Current brief:** Build an innovative solution powered by AI that creates meaningful impact (new applications, enhancing existing processes, or redefining user experiences). Use partner/sponsor technologies where relevant. More details released on the day of the hackathon.

---

## What to submit

1. **Team name**
2. **GitHub repository link** (this repo: https://github.com/danish786saaid/HackTheEast)
3. **2-minute demo video** – problem, solution, live demo of core feature, value proposition. Record when build is stable.

**Sponsor/partner tech:** Check the hackathon sponsors section and prefer their APIs/tools where they fit (judging can reward this).

## Judging criteria – align all work to these

1. **Novelty & creativity** – Unique angle, new ground technically, more creative than alternatives.
2. **Demonstrated use of AI/ML** – Genuine use of AI/ML (not superficial), appropriate models, quality implementation, legitimate training data.
3. **Impact & relevance** – Real problem for real users, scalable beyond prototype, addresses pressing need (HK or global), long-term value.
4. **Presentation & communication** – Clear problem in video, effective demo of core functionality, professional quality, clear value proposition.
5. **Technical implementation and scalability** – Clean code, readable structure, architecture that supports growth, performance, robust error handling, appropriate tech stack.

## Agent behavior

- Prioritize features and code that directly support the five criteria above.
- Prefer sponsor/partner technologies when they fit the solution.
- Keep code organized, documented, and ready for judges to review.
- When the problem statement is updated, refocus implementation to match it.
