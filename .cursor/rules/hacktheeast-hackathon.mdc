# HackTheEast – Agent Context

## Target tracks (one product, three prizes)

### OAX Foundation AI EdTech Platform (HKD 15,000)
**Problem:** Content overload in fast-moving fields (AI, crypto, geopolitics) — impossible to filter and absorb relevant material.
**Criteria:** Real-world learner impact · Timesaving & learning acceleration · Personalisation · Creative thinking

### MiniMax Creative Usage (HKD 15,000)
**Must use:** MiniMax API (LLM, video, audio, music). Multiple MiniMax tools working together for creative experiences.
**Our use:** Tutorial generation (LLM scripts + video + speech + music), news illustration (trending events → video + score).

### RevisionDojo Future of Learning (HKD 15,000)
**Focus:** AI-powered learning: feedback, personalisation, assessment, mastery for strong + struggling learners.
**Our use:** 3–5 step tutorials with completion tracking, progress, and OAX badges.

---

**Our solution — LearnPulse:** AI-powered EdTech platform that uses Exa AI for content discovery, MiniMax for rich tutorial/media generation, and a RevisionDojo-style completion system with badges. "Catch me up" summarises what changed in your tracked domains.

**Key APIs:** Exa AI (semantic search), MiniMax (M2.5 LLM, Hailuo video, Music 2.5, Speech 2.8), Supabase (data).

## What to submit

1. **Team name**
2. **GitHub repository link** (this repo: https://github.com/danish786saaid/HackTheEast)
3. **2-minute demo video** – problem, solution, live demo of core feature, value proposition. Record when build is stable.

**Sponsor/partner tech:** Check the hackathon sponsors section and prefer their APIs/tools where they fit (judging can reward this).

---

## Judging criteria – align all work to these

1. **Novelty & creativity** – Unique angle, new ground technically, more creative than alternatives.
2. **Demonstrated use of AI/ML** – Genuine use of AI/ML (not superficial), appropriate models, quality implementation, legitimate training data.
3. **Impact & relevance** – Real problem for real users, scalable beyond prototype, addresses pressing need (HK or global), long-term value.
4. **Presentation & communication** – Clear problem in video, effective demo of core functionality, professional quality, clear value proposition.
5. **Technical implementation and scalability** – Clean code, readable structure, architecture that supports growth, performance, robust error handling, appropriate tech stack.

## Agent behavior

- Prioritize features and code that directly support the five criteria above.
- Prefer sponsor/partner technologies when they fit the solution.
- Keep code organized, documented, and ready for judges to review.
- When the problem statement is updated, refocus implementation to match it.
